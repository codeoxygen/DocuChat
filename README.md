# DocuChat


This is a web application that allows users to upload multiple PDF files and interact with a chatbot to ask questions about the content of the PDFs. The chatbot utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to extract information from the PDFs and provide relevant answers to the user's queries.

## Features
Upload and process multiple PDF files: Users can upload one or more PDF files through the web interface. The application then extracts the textual content from the PDFs using the powerful Hugging Face library.
Interactive chatbot interface: Users can interact with the chatbot through a user-friendly interface. They can ask questions related to the uploaded PDFs and receive accurate answers based on the extracted content.
Robust natural language understanding: The chatbot employs Langchain, a language model trained on a wide range of data, to understand and interpret user queries effectively. It can handle questions asked in various formats and structures.
Seamless integration with Streamlit: The web application is built using Streamlit, a popular Python library for building interactive web applications. Streamlit provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the chatbot and view the extracted PDF content.
